# DAO Unict - an University System Managament based on Ethereum smart contracts - BACKEND

This project is the main part of my experimental thesis for my Master's Degree in Computer Engineering @ University of Catania. <br />

This Decentralized Autonomous Organization that acts also as Dapp (decentralized application) is intended to replace the centralized approach (like a website) for managing a university system. The DAO manages to perform all the typical functions of students, professors, secretaries, etc through the use of smart contracts and therefore via blockchain. <br />
This part of project was made with Node.js as primary language. It also contains all the smart contracts, written in Solidity, that build up the working mechanism of the DAO. Hardhat and ethers are also used as framework and library. <br />
This repository host only the back-end part that do the follow:
* Deploy the DAO contract and verify it with block confirmations
* Update the frontend communicating the address and the ABI of the deployed contract
* Testing the contract functions <br />
